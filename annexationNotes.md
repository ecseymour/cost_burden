# annexation

Does annexation matter for categorizing cities as growing or shrinking? If a city would have shrunk but for annexation, is it any different from a "true" growing city? These cities would likely have been able to capture more affluent suburbs, increasing their tax base and the overall level of demand in the city. Growing cities without annexation also contain lower-demand submarkets, so this internal heterogeneity does not matter. It is the aggregate demand we are concerned with. Most annexations are quite small, at least in terms of population, so I suspect they don't have an outsized impact in that regard. We were able to remove cities that merged with their counties, which would be cases of large population gains through bounary changes (though the city ceases to exist in essence).
